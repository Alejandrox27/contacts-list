  <p>This simple proyect is a connection frontend and backend<br>
  here i made a simple contact list with the basic functionalities of an api crud<br>
  you can add a new contact or delete it and see all your contacts in a table.<br>
  this program is very basic but it opens doors for me to make much better projects in the future.</p>
